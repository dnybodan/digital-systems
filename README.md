# Digital Designs created by Daniel Nybo

The contents of this repo are digital designs implimented in various HDL languages including VHDL, Verilog 95/2001, and System Verlog, as well as some software applications written in C. These projects include testbenches and tcl sim files; constraints files including timing and resource constraints; and make files. Most are buildable from the command line using Xilinx tools Vivado 2023.1 and Vitis 2023.1 for the Nexys4 DDR board besides the DDR4 DMA project which is intedned for the RFSoC4x2 Zynq Ultrascale+ architecture.
