**Uart Receiver and Testbench** - *Approx 30 Hours Spent*

**Discussion**

The main challenges I faced were with trying to create the spi controller without existing testbenches. I realize this is a part of the task and so it wasn't that bad considering. I also had a hard time connecting the top level state machine to the spi controller. This used a significant portion of my time.
